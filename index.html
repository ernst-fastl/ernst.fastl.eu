                        Ernst worked for me as a team- and technical lead of one Scrum team. His technical skills
                        are
                        outstanding with every respect. He is a solid architect, excellent programmer and great
                        technical all-rounder. On the other hand he got first experience in managing a team in an
                        agile environment, which he managed perfectly well. I really enjoyed working with Ernst and
                        can absolutely recommend him as a strong technical team lead with experience in leading an
                        Agile Scrum team.

                        and collaboration practices to a level I have rarely seen before. Team spirit was always on
                        a high! I especially liked the creative sprint names... Gorilla, Guerillia, ... :-)

                        In a longer timeout I have decided to change professionally.
                        <br><br>
                        After two surgeries, I first devoted myself to my physical health with physiotherapy and sports. During this time I also worked hard on my eating habits and lost more than 10 kg.
                        <br><br>
                        In the second phase of my time out I spent a lot of time in nature. I began to occupy myself more intensively with meditation again.
                        I used this time to reflect more fundamentally about myself and my private and professional future.
                        <br><br>
                        I realized how much I missed the hands-on software development and the design of technology stacks and architectures in my roles as a
                        full-time manager and before that in my role as a full-time Scrum Master.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, I realized that my initial enthusiasm for a career in management had waned due to excessive bureaucracy,
                        corporate political short-sightedness, constant restructuring and the like.
                        <br><br>
                        It became clear to me that it was time to end my full-time management career.Instead, I decided to reorient myself professionally.

                        The ACD and ACS departments functioned as a large double department with a total of about 100
                        employees and consultants (almost the size of a division).
                        <br><br>
                        They were organized in several Scrum and Kanban teams. Each of these teams consisted of
                        employees from both departments. All members of these teams worked together cross-functionally.
                        <br><br>
                        The entire dual department was jointly managed by two department heads (Business Lead and Tech
                        Lead).
                        <br><br>
                        The ACS manager represented the business side and has budget responsibility. He has line
                        responsibility for all analysts and project managers. As head of ACD I was <b>responsible
                        for the technical delivery, all engineers and generally all technical topics</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        Another challenge in the new structure was the urgent need to quickly build a DevOps team. The
                        main tasks of this team are
                        <b>Continuous Integration and fast Delivery, Production Monitoring and Load &amp; Performance

                        for the new team.

                        Making the collaboration between the existing onshore teams and the new nearshore team work was
                        a challenge. I have facilitated regular cross-team meetings and Sykpe calls.
                        I have organized some social events. I have conducted numerous one-on-one discussions with
                        frustrated employees. All of this made it possible that after 2-3 months things were really
                        running smoothly.

                        My first task was to lead a delegation of software developers from europeandirectories.com to
                        Denver Colorado to collaborate with a partner company. I arrived first and established contact
                        with the relevant managers and product owners. Shortly after that I was joined by 3 more
                        colleagues from Vienna.
                        We supported multiple Scrum Teams as engineers for around 5 months.
                        <br><br>
                        After that we built up a completely new department and office location in Vienna. Together with

                        up the base architecture for the new application.
                        After half a year we already had 4 Scrum teams for software development and one Kanban team for
                        system administration.
                        I really enjoyed building up a new team and a new application architecture from scratch.

                    <div> I started at Irian as a Java developer when the company consisted of 5 people (including the
                        two
                        partners). In the first 6 months we developed a database based intranet application for the
                        NYDOP (New York Department of Probation).
                        <br><br>
                        After half a year I moved to Frankfurt because of a project for the Deutsche Bank. Another
                        database based Intranet application with a JSF frontend.
                        I spent 2
                        weeks with one of the partners to set up the architecture for the application. After that the
                        partner left for another project. I was a one-man-show developer in this project for 6 months.
                        When another project was assigned, we gradually brought 3 more developers into the team, which I
                        onboarded into the development team.
                        <br><br>
                        The rest of the years with Irian I stayed at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt until my homesickness
                        made me leave Irian and return to Austria.

                    <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Love of learning</b></h5>
                    <div>
                        I love learning new things, whether on seminars/conferences, online, in books or through
                        experimentation at work. I also like to share my knowledge, translate it for a particular
                        corporate context and teach others by creating in house trainings and workshops or pairing with
                        colleagues. Continuous personal improvement is essential for me.

                    <div>
                        I work hard to finish what I start. No matter the project or initiative I “get it out the door”
                        in timely fashion. I don’t get distracted when I work and take satisfaction in completing tasks.
                        Endurance, patience and commitment enable me to master challenges in the job as well as in my
                        private life.

                    <div>
                        I like to laugh and tease. Bringing smiles to other people is important to me. I put my
                        colleagues at ease with my unyielding optimism and my humorous nature in high pressure
                        situations. Creativity and innovation need a safe environment and cognitive ease. I create those
                        circumstances for my teams so that they can thrive and flourish.

                    <div>
                        I am aware of the motives and feelings of other people. I know what to do to fit in to different
                        social situations, and I know what to do to put others at ease. I can deescalate mounting
                        conflicts and rekindle dull discussions. I encourage teams to get things done while preserving
                        harmony within the group and making everyone feel included. I keep meetings factual and focused.
                        I work in a prioritized and structured fashion and support others in doing so as well.

                    <div>
                        I have high standards for professionalism in software craftsmanship and leadership. I my free
                        time I facilitate coding dojos and code retreats. I am an active member of the Softwerkskammer
                        and the Scrum User Group Austria.

                        Team spirit and healthy relationships are the basis for high performing teams and organizational
                        units. For that trust is necessary. Trust is built on honesty, respect and openness among
                        colleagues. I want to work in an organization where these values are taken seriously.
